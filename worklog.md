# Worklog — perseusR Project

## Date: 2026-01-28

### Summary
So I started with setting the local working repo today from what my group member created on github.  
The problem I encountered was that I forgot to work inside the directory and create a branch. I realized half-way
of my coding today, I took screenshot of my failed git push and the successed part.
