### Summary

So, today's focus was to build the testing files, however, before getting to the build the testing files, there was some issues with the `perseus_regions` file, there was a typo the I just realized this morning, because the merge from yester had failure that I did not notice.\
So, I had fix that. Then, there was some conflicts on github that I had to fix, me and my group member tried different method, then I had to try to delete the cloned repo and re-clone it for a few times. Everythin worked out at the end. So that I was able to push the testing files successfully at the end.

### Tasks Completed
